title: Add authentication fields to Request Template
description: The Request Template is a request editor that lets users set static values that apply to all requests made by this integration. Users can configure the URL params, HTTP headers and request body. This is the perfect place to set authentication fields.

Adding input fields to the Authentication Fields also writes the fields to the Request Template.

By adding fields to the Request Template, they will also show up in the request builder of trigger and actions. The applicable fields for authorization in triggers and actions under Options would then be disabled with help text. You’ll need to access the Request Template under Advanced Settings to make changes to them.
