# Zapier Docs

This is the home of the Zapier docs.

## Structure

These docs are built on Mintlify so please also consult the docs [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart).

These docs are currently stored as a monorepo of developer documentation for various products/solutions we offer at Zapier.
The content is organized as individual folders. Folders can have subfolders but they must be declared in the `mint.json` file for it to render on the site.

`mint.json` is the configuration file for the entire docs site. 

### Running locally
1. Install mintlify `npm i -g mintlify`
2. Run the repo locally `mintlify dev`
