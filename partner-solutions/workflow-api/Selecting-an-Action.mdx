</Note>

Once you've [selected an app](/partner-solutions/api-reference/apps/get-apps-[v2]), we can fetch the list of available actions for a selected App by making a request to the [`/actions` endpoint](/partner-solutions/api-reference/actions/get-actions):

```js
// GET /actions?app=4b3920d6-1d5a-4071-b837-9383dc511b80&action_type=READ
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "action",
      "id": "core:853266",
      "action_type": "READ",
      "title": "New Lead",
      "description": "Triggers when a new lead is added to SuperExampleCRM",
      "is_instant": true
    },
    {
      "type": "action",
      "id": "uag:1f188536-6dd0-4172-8414-2b90914ddee9",
      "action_type": "READ",
      "title": "New Deal",
      "description": "Triggers when a new deal is added to SuperExampleCRM",
      "is_instant": false
    }
  ]
}
```

<Info>`READ` and `WRITE` map to *Trigger* and *Action* respectively In the Zapier ecosystem. </Info>

Our user can then select one of these Actions that they wish to use as the Trigger for their Zap. The `id` field is accepted in several other endpoints.
