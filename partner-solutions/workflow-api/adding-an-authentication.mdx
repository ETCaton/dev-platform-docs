[Adding a missing authentication](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Selecting-an-Authentication#when-no-authentications-exist) for 3rd party apps can be straightforward, but if it's an authentication to your app it can result in sub-optimal UX.

### Adding an authentication to your own app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Confirm your app's `authentication_fields`">
    When you created your app on Zapier's Developer Platform, a required step was to [define the fields required for authentication](https://platform.zapier.com/build/auth). Depending on your authentication scheme the `authentication_fields` below will differ.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Form & send your request">
     Leveraging the [Create Authentication](/partner-solutions/api-reference/authentications/create-authentication) endpoint, supply your app's required `authentication_fields` in the request.
     <CodeGroup>
        ``` js Example with Basic Authentication
            // POST /authentications
            "data": {
                "app": "{MY_APP_ID}",
                "title": "{AUTHENTICATION_NAME}",
                "authentication_fields": {
                    "username": "{MY_USERS_USERNAME}",
                    "password": "{MY_USERS_PASSWORD}"
                }
            }
        ```

        ``` js Example with API Key Authentication
            // POST /authentications
            "data": {
                "app": "{MY_APP_ID}",
                "title": "{AUTHENTICATION_NAME}",
                "authentication_fields": {
                    "api_key": "{MY_USERS_API_KEY}",
                }
            }
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    Be sure to supply whatever `authentication_fields` are required by your apps' authentication scheme.
     <Tip>Pick an authentication name that'll be recognizeable to a user should they find it outside of this flow, such as "Carter's LinkedIn Authentication", or "Micah's Slack Authentication"</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Leverage the new authentication in subsequent workflow steps âœ¨">
    A successful response from this request will include an `id`, which can be used in subsequent steps.
  </Step>
