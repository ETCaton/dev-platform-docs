title: Hardcoding an Action
description: To help focus the user experience, it can be helpful to hardcode a certain Action to guide users in selecting the most appropriate action for their use-case.
---

<Warning>While it may be tempting to reuse the `id` field returned by the `/actions`
endpoint, this is unsupported. The `id` field should not be considered stable, and the `key` field should instead be used.</Warning>

To hardcode an action, first make a request to the [`/actions` endpoint](/partner-solutions/api-reference/actions/get-actions), filtered by App using the `app` query param (e.g.
`/actions?app=dc4dfc3e-c5bd-47a4-ac85-6d5ef8a50c50`).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Store the App ID">
    This ID is guaranteed to remain the same for a particular
App, even as different versions of the App are promoted in the background.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look up the list of Actions by App ID">
    i.e.
`/api/v2/actions?app=768dedb4-54b8-4585-a166-2140216e9b13`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter for the Action required using the `key` field.">
    This is the value
provided in the Zapier Developer Platform, and remains the same for the same
action across versions. The Action ID field returned can then be used as usual to create a Zap.
  </Step>
</Steps>
