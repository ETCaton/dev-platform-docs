title: 'Retrieving Zap Templates'
description: 'Zap templates are pre-made Zaps that help users discover popular use cases for automating their work. Each template features a specific use case and the apps needed for it to work.'

### Prerequisites

- Your app needs to be published as a [public integration](https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/private-vs-public-integrations) in Zapier’s App Directory.
- Only `published` Zap templates will be visible through the API.


### Example Implementation
