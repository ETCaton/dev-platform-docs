title: Fields and Fieldsets
---

There are two main types of fields to consider when dealing with the Zapier API:
input fields and output fields:

<Card title="Input fields" icon="inbox-in" iconType="duotone">
  Those that are provided to an Action so that it can run. They are analogous to
  the arguments that a function takes.
</Card>
<Card title="Output fields" icon="inbox-out" iconType="duotone">
  Those that are returned by an Action. These may then be _mapped_ into the input
  fields of a subsequent Action in a Zap.
</Card>

## Input Fields

To fetch the input fields for an Action, make a request to the
`/actions/{action_id}/inputs` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```js Request
// POST /actions/core:853266/inputs
{
  "data": {
    "authentication": "762331",
    "inputs": {}
  }
}
```

```js Response
// POST /actions/core:853266/inputs
{
  "data": [
    {
			"type": "input_field",
			"id": "spreadsheet",
			"default_value": "",
			"depends_on": [],
			"description": "The spreadsheet to add a new row",
			"format": "SELECT",
			"invalidates_input_fields": true,
			"is_required": true,
			"placeholder": "",
			"title": "Spreadsheet",
			"value_type": "STRING"
		}
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Invalidation

The `invalidates_input_fields` field signifies whether the input fields should
be _refetched_ from `/inputs` when the value of the given field is changed. A real-world example
of when this might be required is for spreadsheet apps. When adding a new row to
a sheet, the first input field allows the user to select the relevant sheet and,
once that is selected, more input fields become available (one for each column
in the selected sheet). If the user changes the sheet, then the input fields
must be refetched.

When making a request to refetch the input fields, make sure to include all the
fields that have been populated so far:

<CodeGroup>

```js Request
// POST /actions/core:5381/inputs
{
  "data": {
    "authentication": "928117",
    "inputs": {
      "spreadsheet": "my_sheet"
    }
  }
}
```

```js Response
// POST /actions/core:5381/inputs
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "input_field",
      "id": "spreadsheet",
      "title": "Spreadsheet",
      "description": "The spreadsheet to add a row to.",
      "value_type": "string",
      "format": "SELECT",
      "depends_on": [],
      "is_required": true,
      "invalidates_input_fields": true
    },
    {
      "type": "input_field",
      "id": "worksheet",
      "title": "Worksheet",
      "description": "The worksheet to add a row to.",
      "value_type": "string",
      "format": "SELECT",
      "depends_on": ["spreadsheet"],
      "is_required": true,
      "invalidates_input_fields": true
    },
    {
      "type": "input_field",
      "id": "column_A",
      "title": "Column A",
      "description": "",
      "value_type": "string",
      "depends_on": [],
      "is_required": false,
      "invalidates_input_fields": false
    },
    {
      "type": "input_field",
      "id": "column_B",
      "title": "Column B",
      "description": "",
      "value_type": "string",
      "depends_on": [],
      "is_required": false,
      "invalidates_input_fields": false
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

In this example, if the user changes the value of `spreadsheet`, we should refetch `/inputs` and pass this new value to reload all fields.
 If `worksheet` is modified, once again we'd refetch `/inputs` and reload the non-dependant fields. 
 This is because both `spreadsheet` and `worksheet` have `invalidates_input_fields` field set to `true`.

### Dependencies

Sometimes one input field _depends_ on one or more other fields, meaning `/inputs` should be refetched 
if any of the dependent fields are changed. This is represented via the `depends_on` array field, which has strings of field IDs in
it. Continuing with the spreadsheet example, the `worksheet` field depends on
the `spreadsheet` field. That is, if the user changes which spreadsheet they are
working in, the value of the worksheet field must be cleared (and `/inputs` refetched)---as the set of
inputs available for the action will now be different.

### Input Field Types
<Note>[Input Field Schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/inputField)</Note>
The `value_type` key indicates what type of user data is accepted for a given field.

Per [the schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/inputField), the options for `value_type` are: `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `INTEGER`, `BOOLEAN`, `ARRAY`, and `OBJECT`. 
The following variants warrant additional consideration:  

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Array fields">
    Array fields accept JSON arrays of the underlying value type. The `items`
    key will be defined for arrays, and it will contain a key `type` with the
    value type of the array items.

    This input field:
    ``` js
    "column_names": {
      "value_type": "ARRAY",
      "items": {
        "type": "STRING"
      }
    }
    ```
    would accept this value:
    ```js
    "column_names": ["Word", "Definition"]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Object fields">
    Object fields accept JSON objects with arbitrary keys and _string_ values.

    This input field:
    ```js
    "dictionary": {
      "value_type": "OBJECT"
    }
    ```
    would accept this value:
    ```js
    "dictionary": {
      "apple": "A fruit!",
      "salmon": "A fish!"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Boolean fields">
      While boolean fields are logically `true` or `false`, their actual values can
      change depending on the specific action. For this reason boolean values are paired with a `format` 
      of `SELECT` and options should be fetched from `/choices`. See [choices](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Fields-and-Fieldsets#choices) for more information.
      This input field:
      ```js
      {
        "type": "input_field",
        "id": "replace_all_rows",
        "format": "SELECT",
        "value_type": "BOOLEAN"
        ...
      }
      ```
      would require a request to `/choices`; 
      ``` js
      // repsonse from POST https://api.zapier.com/v2/actions/core:gq7MXdsdsaaqqDBj/inputs/replace_all_rows/choices
      {
        "id": "False",
        "type": "choice",
        "label": "No",
        "value": "False"
      },
      {
        "id": "True",
        "type": "choice",
        "label": "Yes",
        "value": "True"
      }
      ```
      and ultimately would accept this value:
      ```js
      "False"
      ```
      Where this is the `id` of the selection. See [choices](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Fields-and-Fieldsets#choices) for more information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup> 

### Input Formats
 The `format` key indicates how to present a given input field to the user, per [the schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/inputField).
 Its options are: `DATETIME`, `MULTILINE`, `PASSWORD`, `CODE`, `READONLY`, `FILE`, `SELECT`. Additional information on 
 how these fields are processed by Zapier can be found in our [help docs](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496259603341-Different-field-types-in-Zaps).

 The following variants warrant additional consideration:
 <AccordionGroup> 
   <Accordion title="Readonly fields">
      These fields are to be presented as text only, and require no input. The `description` field contains the text to be presented.
      ```js
      "format": "READONLY"
      ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File fields">
      These fields should contain a URL to a file, which will be fetched during zap execution by the zapier platform.
      ```js
      "format": "FILE"
      ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Select fields">
      These fields require an additional request to `/choices` to fetch the choices available for 
      that input. See [choices](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Fields-and-Fieldsets#choices) for more information.
      ```js
      "format": "SELECT"
      ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup> 

### Choices

<Note>[Choice Schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/choice)</Note>

When the `format` key is equal to `SELECT`, the `/choices` endpoint returns a list of options from which the user should select.

Continuing the spreadsheet example, the first input field is (`spreadsheet`) which is
a `string` type. The `format` is `SELECT`, which implies this field has a set of
_choices_ for the user to select from (which would normally be rendered as a
dropdown menu in the UI).

To fetch these, use the `/actions/{action_id}/inputs/{input_id}/choices`
endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```js Request
// POST /actions/core:853266/inputs/spreadsheet/choices
{
  "data": {
    "authentication": "762331",
    "inputs": {}
  }
}
```

```js Response
// POST /actions/core:853266/inputs/spreadsheet/choices
{
  "data": [
    {
			"id": "ABCD12345",
			"type": "choice",
			"label": "Group Standup",
			"value": "ABCD12345"
    },
    {
			"id": "ABCDE123456",
			"type": "choice",
			"label": "Incident Tracking",
			"value": "ABCDE123456"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

So, this input field has only two choices available. When making a zap pass the `id` of the selected choice for the desired input.


### Fieldsets

<Note>[Fieldset Schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/fieldset)</Note>

Input fields may be _grouped_ together into fieldsets (just like in HTML). This
gives a hint as to how the fields should be rendered in the UI.

Only one level of nesting is supported (a Fieldset cannot be contained within
another Fieldset).

### Informational Fields

<Note>[Info Field Schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/infoField)</Note>

An informational field is one that has no input, but contains some
markdown-formatted text which should be rendered in the relevant position in the
form. This is often used to give helpful tips to the user.

## Output Fields

<Note>[Output Field Schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/outputField)</Note>

Once the user has populated all the input fields, we can determine which output
fields are available from the given action using the
`/actions/{action_id}/outputs` endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```js Request
// POST /actions/core:853266/outputs
{
  "data": {
    "authentication": "762331",
    "inputs": {
      "worksheet": "ABC123",
      "spreadsheet": "EFGH456"
    }
  }
}
```

```js Response
// POST /actions/core:853266/outputs
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "output_field",
      "id": "id",
      "title": "Id",
      "sample": "1"
    },
    {
      "type": "output_field",
			"id": "COL$A",
			"title": "Col$A",
			"sample": "Value in column A"
    },
    {
			"type": "output_field",
			"id": "COL$B",
			"title": "Col$B",
			"sample": "Value in column B"
    },
    {
			"type": "output_field",
			"id": "COL$C",
			"title": "Col$C",
			"sample": "Value in column C"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

In reality, many more output fields would likely be available. For details on
how these can be mapped into the input fields of subsequent steps in a Zap, see
[Building a Zap](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Building-a-Zap).
