title: Testing a Step
description: Step testing allows for the validation of a configured step, executing any `READ` or `WRITE` actions.
---

After supplying the required inputs for a given action, it can be helpful to validate the configuration by testing the action, in a similar way the main editor at zapier.com requires step testing. While not required via this API, it can be helpful to test actions;
- When there are common configuration challenges specific to your use case.
- To reduce the chance of user error when creating workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Supply all the necessary inputs for a given action">
    Following the steps to [Build a Zap](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Building-a-Zap), retrieve all necessary inputs and authentications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the test">
    Leveraging the [/test](/partner-solutions/api-reference/actions/step-test) endpoint, make a request supplying all of the necessary `inputs` along with an `authentication` - or `null` if none is required.
    
    For example for an authenticated action with id `core:wJ3PxHpNArZ8MqvloW3L1ZyMDQ4nJ`, we might make the following request:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```js Request
    //POST /actions/core:wJ3PxHpNArZ8MqvloW3L1ZyMDQ4nJ/test
    "data": {
		"authentication": "KrG4mmZs",
		"inputs" : {
			"channel": "G45J5309P",
			"text": ":rotating_light: THIS IS A TEST :rotating_light:",
			"as_bot": "yes",
			"username": "Step Test",
			"icon": ":robot:"
		}
	}
    ```

    ```js Successful Test Response
    {
	"links": {
		"next": null,
		"prev": null
	},
	"meta": {
		"count": 1,
		"limit": null,
		"offset": null
	},
    //Note: the data returned along with it's schema is unique to the action being performed. 
	"data": [
		{
			"channel": "G45J5309P",
			"ts": "1704292753.233659",
			"message": {
				"type": "message",
				"subtype": "bot_message",
				"text": ":rotating_light: THIS IS A TEST :rotating_light:",
				"ts": "1704292753.233659",
				"username": "Step Test",
				"icons": {
					"emoji": ":robot:"
				}
            }
            ...
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
	```js Successful Test Response (no results)
	// Note: Tests that are configured correctly but return 0 results are returned with a 200 OK status code.
    {
	"links": {
		"next": null,
		"prev": null
	},
	"meta": {
		"count": 0,
		"limit": null,
		"offset": null
	}, 
	"data": []
    }
    ```
    ```js Failed Test Response
    {
	"errors": [
		{
			"status": 400,
			"code": "test_failed",
			"title": "ActionTestError",
			"detail": "Error during execution: Error from Slack: channel_not_found",
			"source": null,
			"meta": {
				"source": "ZAPIER",
				"full_details": {
					"message": "Error during execution: Error from Slack: channel_not_found",
					"code": "test_failed"
				}
			}
		}
	]
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>Note that in the event of a successful test, the `data` object returned is directly from the 3rd party app, and therefore has no defined schema. </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up any created resources as part of the test">
    If possible, clean up any created resources as part of a successful test. Remember the test executes the action, so these assets could cause confusion for users should they discover them after a successful test.
