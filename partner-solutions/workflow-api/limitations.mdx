title: Known Limitations
description: Creating workflows using the Zapier Workflow API is a recent addition, and there are some known limitations.
---

- Zaps are currently limited to two steps. eg. a `READ` action and a `WRITE` action. Zaps with more than two steps are not supported.
- Zaps can only be created with Public Apps. Private Apps are not currently supported.
- More complex Action types, such as Searches, Filters, and Paths, are not supported.
- The API does not currently have an endpoint to turn off/on a user's Zaps. If your Zapier app uses [Webhook Subscriptions](https://platform.zapier.com/build/hook-trigger), you can send a `DELETE` to the unique target URL that was provided when the subscription was created and that will then pause/turn off a Zap.
- Webhook `READ` actions are not currently supported.

If you've got a use case that you think *should* be supported, let us know!
