title: Selecting an Authentication
description: Support users in selecting 3rd party authentications, either through an existing authentication or by adding new.

An Authentication is a set of user credentials for an [App](/partner-solutions/api-reference/apps/get-apps-[v2]) that is stored securely by Zapier. When required, a user must select which of the Authentications they have for that App (they may have multiple) that they would like to use when a Zap executes. 

<Note>
[Authentication Schema](/partner-solutions/api-reference/common-types/authentication)
</Note>

We can fetch a list of Authentications available for an App by making a request to the [`/authentications` endpoint](/partner-solutions/api-reference/authentications/get-authentications):

```js
// GET /authentications?app=4b3920d6-1d5a-4071-b837-9383dc511b80
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "authentication",
      "id": "49509",
      "app": "4b3920d6-1d5a-4071-b837-9383dc511b80",
      "title": "SuperExampleCRM (wade@zapier.com)",
      "is_expired": false
    },
    {
      "type": "authentication",
      "id": "96983",
      "app": "4b3920d6-1d5a-4071-b837-9383dc511b80",
      "title": "SuperExampleCRM (bryan@zapier.com)",
      "is_expired": false
    }
  ]
}
```
Our user can then select one of these Authentications to use with a Zap.

## When no Authentications exist
It's possible that the user doesn't have _any_ Authentications for an App they've picked, as in every case when it's a new Zapier account. In these cases the `/authentications` endpoint will return an empty list under the `data` key. In this scenario, we should direct the user to the url provided by the `/apps` endpoint under the `links.connect_new_authentication` key to add a new Authentication.

This is also the best approach to take if you want to offer the user the option to use a new Authentication with this Zap, even if they already have Authentications available. (e.g. If the user wants to use a different SuperExampleCRM account than the ones already linked to Zapier)

<Note>
  If `links.connect_new_authentication` is `null`, then this app doesn't require authentication, and `null` should be passed instead of a valid id. Read more about that [below](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/Selecting-an-Authentication#when-authentication-is-not-required).
</Note>

### Directing the user to create a new Authentication
The best way to use this `links.connect_new_authentication` link is as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the `links.connect_new_authentication` link in a popup">
    In this popup, the user will be prompted to authenticate with the app, and to allow Zapier to access that app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an event listener to listen for `zapier.popup.close` messages from that popup">
     A message with that type will be posted when the auth flow in the popup is complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="From the message, retrieve the new `authentication_id`">
    Afterwards, use that `authentication_id` to continue the Zap creation process

    ```js
    // 1. Open a popup window to the `links.  connect_new_authentication` url. 
    const authPopup = window.open(app.links.  connect_new_authentication, '_blank', 'width=1280,height=1024');
    if (!authPopup) {
        alert("Please allow popups to continue.");
      return;
    }

    // 2. Add an event listener to be alerted when the user has completed the auth flow.
    window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
      if (event.origin === 'https://zapier.com') {
        const action = event.data;
        if (action?.type === "zapier.popup.close") {
          if (authPopup) {  // In case popup has already been closed
            authPopup.close();
          }
          const new_authentication_id = action.authentication_id;
          // 3. Use `new_authentication_id` to continue the Zap creation process.
          // The `new_authentication_id` is the id of the authentication that the 
          // user just created.
        }
      }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>Looking to add an authentication to your own app? You can supply auth details directly and streamline the process. Check out [Adding an Authentication](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/adding-an-authentication).</Tip>

## When Authentication is not required

Some apps don't require authentication at all - like Webhooks. You'll know this is the case when fetching the app and it's not possible to add a new authentication.
``` js Sample response from /apps
...
"links": {
          "connect_new_authentication": null
        },
...
```

When creating zaps with these apps, `null` should be passed in place of a valid authentication id;
<CodeGroup>
``` js Sample POST to /inputs
// POST https://api.zapier.com/v2/actions/core:8yjfgwyq03zskh3LOe9jPa5dOeW/inputs
{
  "data": {
    "authentication": null,
    "inputs": {}
  }
}
```

``` js Sample POST to /zaps
// POST https://api.zapier.com/v2/zaps
...
"steps": [
      ...
      {
        "action": "core:3ZYFzZKkjbDK2AwQopVqrZWL9pK",
        "inputs": {
          "url": "https://greatWebhooks.com/myWebhook"
        },
        "authentication": null
      }
    ]
...
```
