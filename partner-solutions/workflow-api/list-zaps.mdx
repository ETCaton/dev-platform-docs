### Prerequisites

- Your app needs to be published as a [public integration](https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/private-vs-public-integrations) in Zapier's App Directory.


### Example Implementation

## Fetching a list of Zaps for a user

<Steps>
    <Step title="Authenticate with Zapier">
        Following the [authentication guide](/partner-solutions/api-reference/authentication), receive a token from the Zapier Workflow API.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create your request, and filter as needed">
        Leverage the [`/zaps` endpoint](/partner-solutions/api-reference/zaps/get-zaps-[v2]) to fetch a users zaps.
        - You can optionally filter the list by specific input values, which can be helpful for instances where a user has a zap associated to specific resources. Example might be a specific trello board or google sheet. See [the api-reference](/partner-solutions/api-reference/zaps/get-zaps-[v2]) for more info. 
        - Leverage the `expand` parameter to return 
        additional zap detail such as step information.
        - Use the `zap:all` scope to return _all_ owned zaps on a users acccount regardless of paired apps. 
        <Info> By default, only zaps that contain the authenticating app and that are **owned** by the user are returned. Shared zaps or zaps the user may have permission to view/edit will not be returned. </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Integrate with your product">
        Shape the zaps returned to match the look and feel of your product, showcasing any existing workflows âœ¨
    </Step>
</Steps>
