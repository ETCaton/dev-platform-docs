title: Errors
description: Errors in the API follow the <a href="https://jsonapi.org/format/#error-objects" target="_blank">recommendation</a> from the JSON API spec.

An example error object returned in a response body looks like this:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "400",
      "title": "Bad Request",
      "detail": "The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.",
      "source": {
        "pointer": "/data/attributes/first-name"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Other potential error codes that may be returned are:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="401 Unauthorized" icon="circle" iconType="solid" color="#dbdb00">
  </Card>
  <Card title="403 Forbidden" icon="circle" iconType="solid" color="#FF0000">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

In all cases the response will be a JSON object with a single key `errors` which will be an array of error objects.
