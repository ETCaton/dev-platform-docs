Currently all endpoints are rate limited by the following, whichever occurs first:
-  IP address, and is limited to **60 requests per minute.**
-  Partner, and is limited to **150 requests per minute.**


## Rate Limit Response
If you hit the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests`. There will be a cooldown of 60 seconds before you can make any more requests.
