<Info>Zapier's partner solutions are available for public integrations. To take advantage, first ensure your integration has been published to [Zapier's App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps). If your integration isn't yet published, learn more about [submitting your integration for review](https://platform.zapier.com/publish/public-integration#4-submit-your-integration-for-app-review).</Info>

Our partner solutions offer the most efficient and comprehensive ways to add automation and surface integrations directly within your product. Whether you aim to build native automated workflows for your users or simply display the most popular integration use cases, our [Workflow API](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/intro) and [Workflow Element](/partner-solutions/workflow-element/intro) provide robust solutions to meet your needs. These tools replace the need to develop your own automation capabilities, ensuring you can deliver powerful automation experiences to your users with ease.

## What are the different partner solutions?
We have 2 main products for you to add automation to your product:
1. Our [Workflow API](/partner-solutions/workflow-api/intro) is a powerful tool for building native integrations and workflows powered by Zapier for your end users in your product 
2. Our [Workflow Element](/partner-solutions/workflow-element/intro) is a prebuilt UI component that offers the quickest and easiest way to integrate Zapier directly into your product. With just a few lines of code from our code generator, it provides a complete end-to-end automation solution, allowing users to discover, create, and maintain automated workflows.

Along with our main products, we have a suite of product enhancements, meant to help create an even more frictionless experience for your users
1. [Pre-filled Zaps](/partner-solutions/pre-filled-zaps) allow you to define the input fields on behalf of the user, simplying the experience of setting up their Zap.
2. [Quick Account Creation](/partner-solutions/quick-account-creation) is a seamless, accelerated sign-up feature allowing first time Zapier users to skip the standard sign-up procedure and onboarding survey and have an account created on their behalf. 
3. [Guess a Zap (New! ✨)](/partner-solutions/api-reference/zaps/guess-a-zap) Simplifies the automation setup process by using natural language to help users describe what they want to automate. Guess a Zap analyzes their description and suggests the most relevant workflows, minimizing the need for manual setup and helping users quickly find the right automation.
4. [Workflow Steps (New! ✨)](/partner-solutions/experimental/create-a-workflow-step) enables you to augment your native workflow tools with Zapier’s apps and actions.
