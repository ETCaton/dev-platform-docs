## Embed insights definitions
Embed features are available for public integrations. All metrics can be filtered by All Embeds or individual embeds, and the last 7, 30, and 90 days, hover over the metric to see the percentage and count figures. To view insights from your embed, visit the [Zapier Developer Platform](https://developer.zapier.com/).

Definitions for each of the metrics provided in the integration dashboard below:

|Metric | Definition|
|-------|-----------|
|Total conversion	| Percentage of users who clicked on Zap Templates and activated a Zap.|
|Users who clicked on Zap Templates |	Percentage and count of users who clicked on a Zap Template in an embed.|
|Users who signed up for Zapier	| Percentage and count of users who signed up for a new account on Zapier.|
|Users who created Zaps	| Percentage and count of users who started a Zap in the editor.|
|Users who enabled Zaps	| Percentage and count of users who created and successfully published a Zap.|
|Users who activated Zaps	| Percentage and count of users who created a Zap that successfully ran tasks.|

## Best practices
- Test different iterations of embeds and compare rates to see which ones resonate most with your users. Do certain sets of Zap Templates garner more clicks and activations than others? Does enabling “App search” on the Workflow Element, so users can see all the apps they can integrate with, increase activations?
- Improve your Zap Templates with short, descriptive titles, and as much [prefilled field](/partner-solutions/pre-filled-zaps) mapping as possible, so users are immediately aware of the use case and can activate the Zap with the least amount of clicks.
- Provide context with your embed through help docs or an onboarding flow guiding users on how to connect your app with others using Zapier to improve the Users who signed up for Zapier rate.
