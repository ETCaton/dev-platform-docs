## Step 1: Get a Partner Key for Authentication

Follow the steps below to create your API key:

1. [Log in](https://actions.zapier.com/custom/start/) or [sign up](https://zapier.com/sign-up) to Zapier.
2. [Connect](https://actions.zapier.com/custom/actions/) your Zapier account to the `custom` integration app.
3. Your API key will be available on the [credentials page](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/).

Test that the API key is working:

```bash
curl -v \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \```
    'https://actions.zapier.com/api/v2/check/'
```

## Step 2: Set Up Allowed Actions

Now that you're authenticated, let's set up the actions you're allowed to execute.

Actions can be configured by you at a specific URL or with our quick configuration popup.

The setup URL is the same for everyone: `https://actions.zapier.com/<PROVIDER>/start/`.

## Step 3: Execute an Action via the API

With your partner key and actions set up, you're ready for action.

To run an action, you need to execute a command like the one below, filling in the `instructions` and any optional hint parameters.

        ```bash run_action1.sh
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "grab the latest email from bryan helmig"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://actions.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTA3G1WD49GN1XXXXXXXXX/execute/'
One more example, this time requesting a preview of the action:
```

```bash run_action2.sh
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "send a short poem about automation and robots to slack", "Channel_Name": "#fun-zapier"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://actions.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'
Another example, this time an action to retrieve data:
```

    ```bash preview_action_run.sh
curl -v \
    -d '{"instructions": "say Hello World to #fun-zapier", "preview_only": true}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST 'https://actions.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/exposed/01GTB1KMX72QTJEXXXXXXXXXX/execute/'
```
