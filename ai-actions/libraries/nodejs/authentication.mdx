title: Authentication
---

# Introduction

There are two methods that can be used to authenticate with `@zapier/ai-actions`:

- [API Key](#api-key): If you plan on only using the AI Actions client to interact with AI Actions on your behalf
- [OAuth](#oauth): If you plan on creating an OAuth app to allow users to interact with AI Actions on their behalf

## API Key

Your API key can be retrieved from the [Credentials page](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/).

<Warning>
**Treat your API key like a password.**

It can be used to run your AI Actions.

For example: if you set up a "Gmail: Find email" action, anyone with your API key can read all your email.

</Warning>

Create an `AiActions` client with the API key:

```ts
import { AiActions } from "@zapier/ai-actions";

const client = new AiActions({
  auth: {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});
```

## OAuth

### Creating an OAuth app

  Click here to create a new OAuth app to use for authenticating with AI
  Actions.
  <Tip>
    In order to work with the API client, **your app must have "Public Client"
    checked.**

### Getting an OAuth token

#### Creating the `AiActionsAuth` object

`@zapier/ai-actions` provides a helper class to handle the auth process.

This is done with the `AiActionsAuth` class:

```ts
import { AiActionsAuth } from "@zapier/ai-actions";

const aiActionsAuth = new AiActionsAuth({
  clientId: "YOU_APP_CLIENT_ID",
  redirectUri: "YOUR_APP_REDIRECT_URI",
});
```

#### Storing the code verifier securely

`@zapier/ai-actions` uses the [OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow](https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html) to facilitate the OAuth process. As part of this, a "code verifier" is generated.

<Warning>
  By default, `AiActionsAuth` will store the verifier in the browser's
  `localStorage`.

**This is not recommended for production use** since it can be easily accessed
by malicious scripts, and it will not work server-side.

</Warning>

To facilitate storing the code verifier securely, the constructor for `AiActionsAuth` has options that can be used.

```ts
import { AiActionsAuth } from "@zapier/ai-actions";

const aiActionsAuth = new AiActionsAuth({
  clientId: "YOU_APP_CLIENT_ID",
  redirectUri: "YOUR_APP_REDIRECT_URI",
  async storeVerifier(verifier) {
    // store the verifier somewhere secure for your user (i.e. database or KV store)
  },
  async getVerifier(): Promise<string> {
    // this function MUST return the verifier stored for the user by `storeVerifier`
    // each verifier can only be used once, and it must be consistend throughout the OAuth flow
  },
});
```

#### Generating the authorization OR quick account creation URL

Once you have an `AiActionsAuth` object, you can use it to generate the authorization URL:

```tsx
const authUrl = await aiActionsAuth.generateAuthUrl();

// ...

<a href={authUrl}>Authenticate with AI Actions</a>;
```

This URL can be used to redirect the user to the authorization page. Once the user has authorized your app, they will be redirected to the `redirectUri` you provided.

---

You can also generate a **quick account creation** URL. This will ensure that the user has a Zapier account before authorizing your app.

If they do not have a Zapier account, one will be created for them. If they already have a Zapier account, they will be asked to log in on zapier.com.

```tsx
const quickAccountCreationUrl = await aiActionsAuth.generateCreateAccountUrl(
  "Firstname",
  "Lastname",
  "user@example.com"
);

// ...

<a href={quickAccountCreationUrl}>Authenticate with AI Actions</a>;
```

After going through this flow, they will end up back on the `redirectUri` that you provided.

#### Getting an access token

After authorizing your app, the user will be redirected to the `redirectUri` you provided along with a `code` query parameter.

This `code` can now be used to get an access token

```ts
import { AiActions } from "@zapier/ai-actions";

// `code` will be in the query params; get it however you like (most likely server-side)
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const code = urlParams.get("code");

// this access token can now be used to generate an AiActions client
const oauthToken = await aiActionsAuth.getToken(code);

const aiActionsClient = new AiActions({
  auth: {
    token: oauthToken.access_token,
  },
});

try {
  // this will pass if auth succeeds, or throw an error if it fails
  await aiActionsClient.checkAuth();
} catch (e) {
  console.error("Error checking AI Actions auth", e);
}
```

#### Refreshing the access token

Access tokens expire after a certain amount of time. To refresh the token, you can use the `refreshToken` method along with the `refresh_token`:

```ts
import {
  OAuthAccessToken,
  refreshOAuthToken,
  tokenNeedsRefresh,
} from "@zapier/ai-actions";

// get the stored token for the current user; `getAiActionsToken` is a placeholder for your own function
const oauthToken: OAuthAccessToken = await getAiActionsToken();

if (tokenNeedsRefresh(oauthToken)) {
  const refreshed = await refreshOAuthToken({
    clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    refreshToken: oauthToken.refresh_token,
  });

  if (refreshed) {
    // `setAiActionsToken` is a placeholder for your own function
    await setAiActionsToken(refreshed);
  }
}
```
