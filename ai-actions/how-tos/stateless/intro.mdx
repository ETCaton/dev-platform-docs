When running a stateless action, all of the parameters that are needed for it to run are provided at runtime.

See [Gathering Action Information](/how-tos/action-info/introduction) for details on how to build up the needed values that are required

See [Run a Stateless Action](/how-tos/stateless/run-stateless-action) for information on actually running the action.
