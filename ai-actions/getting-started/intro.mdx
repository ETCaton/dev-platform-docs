title: Introduction
description: AI Actions exposes Zapier's 7,000+ apps and 30,000+ actions, for selected partners, to build your own custom AI assistants.

You can use the API to:

- Send messages in Slack
- Add a row to a Google Sheet
- Draft a new email in Gmail
- And thousands of other app actions, all with one universal natural language API.

AI Actions is optimized for receiving user input in natural language like chat, assistant, or other large language model based experience. Think of AI Actions as a more human-friendly integrations API.

## Integrations made easy

AI Actions contains a decade of Zapier's experience in solving API shenanigans, so you don't have to.

Here are some common API complexities, automatically handled by AI Actions.

- **Support for every type of auth**: Zapier securely handles and signs requests for you including Basic, Session, API Key, OAuth v1, Oauth v2, and Digest.
- **Support for create, update, and search actions**: With endpoints optimized for natural language usage.
- **Support for custom fields**: Spreadsheet, CRM, and mailing list friendly.
- **Reference by name, not ID**: Humans use natural language names, not IDs, to reference things in their apps, so AI Actions does too.
- **Smart, human defaults**: APIs sometimes have 100 options. Zapier's platform data helps us make AI Actions simpler for users out of the box.

## API design notes

Here are a few design choices we've made with this API.

- Let individual users control access to their actions and accounts.
- Minimize the amount of work users must do to set up and run actions.
- Let users override the AI when desired.
