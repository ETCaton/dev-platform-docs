title: Recommended triggers and actions
description: "Whether you’re just starting to scope out a new Zapier integration build or have successfully launched your app in the Zapier App Directory, it’s helpful to know what features users find the most valuable and are the most widely used across Zapier’s various [app categories](https://zapier.com/apps). Ensuring your integration covers the foundational triggers, actions, and searches applicable to your app will provide more utility to your users."

## Top Triggers, Actions, and Searches by App Category

The lists provided do not encompass every possible model or object specific to individual apps. Rather, they represent a more general overview of the most frequently observed ones in each category to serve as a guide to apply to your own app. Remember to maintain consistent terminology between your Zapier integration and app platform so users have a clear connection between the two.

Maybe your CRM platform, refers to new entries as _Contacts_. On another, they could be called _Leads_, _Clients_, _Persons_, or any term unique to the platform, such as _Hoomans_ or _Zaperonis_. You may not find _Zaperonis_ listed below, but if you see a similar concept like a _New Contact_ trigger, you can apply the same logic with a _New Zaperoni_ trigger for your integration.

If you don’t see a list for your specific category, there may not have sufficient integrations within it to surface best practices. Reach out to [Partner support](https://developer.zapier.com/contact) to request a category.

\*Cover the most popular models of your platform at a minimum. You can create individual triggers, actions, and searches for each model such as, “New Customer”, “New Deal”, “Create Customer”, and “Create Deal”. Or create a singular trigger, action, and search that each support multiple models by requiring users to select which model they’re taking action on via an input field, such as “New Record” and “Create Record”.

\*\*_Updated_ triggers for CRMs are often most useful when users are able to specify which field(s) to watch for updates on, instead of triggering on any and all updates.
