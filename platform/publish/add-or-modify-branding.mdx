## Platform UI

It is also required to complete the Intended Audience, your role and the app's category.

## Platform CLI

When creating a new integration in the Platform CLI, you can optionally add the app name, description, and homepage URL to the `package.json` file. The rest of your app's branding needs to be added in the Platform UI once you `zapier push` your integration for the first time.

Build your integration locally first. Once you've added your app's core details, authentication, triggers, and actions, push your integration to Zapier with a `zapier push` command. Zapier will use the name you added in the CLI integration settings, along with a placeholder icon for your app.

Next, add your app's branding via the Platform UI at [developer.zapier.com/](https://developer.zapier.com/). There you will see every Zapier integration you've built. The _My integrations_ section includes every app you've added via Zapier's Platform UI or CLI. Look for the integration you built with Zapier CLI and select.

Only the branding for your CLI-built app can be edited in the UI; authentication, triggers, and actions must be edited in your local environment and pushed to Zapier.

To edit branding, select the gear icon in the upper left hand corner near your app's name and placeholder icon. Edit your integration's name and description, and upload your app's logo (a square, transparent PNG at least 256x256px), meeting [requirements](/platform/publish/branding-guidelines). Below that, set your app's Intended Audience, your role and the app's category. Select _Save_.

## Modify or rebrand your integration

### Private integrations

For integrations in `private` status, branding can be updated anytime on the Integration Settings page. Access Integration Settings by clicking the gear icon to the right of the integration name.

### Public/Beta integrations

For integrations in `public` or `beta` status, branding changes need to be processed by our Partner Support team. To request branding changes, visit the Integration Settings page and click the form linked at the top of the page.

The app ID and your Zapier account email will automatically populate into the form. Provide only the details you want updated on your integration's directory page, and submit the form. You'll receive a confirmation email of your submission, and the Partner Support team will process the changes within 1 business day. You'll receive a second email confirming once the changes have been made.
