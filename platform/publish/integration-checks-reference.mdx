title: Integration check reference
description: "Before you can submit your integration for publishing, it runs through a set of automated checks to ensure it’s working properly and giving our users (and yours) the best possible experience."
---

To [publish your integration](/platform/publish/public-integration), all Errors and Publishing Tasks must be validated. Warnings are non-blocking and not strictly required to proceed as they would not prevent you from promoting a version, though we do recommend you review them for usability of your integration.

If your integration will remain private, it isn’t _necessary_ to pass the validation checks. You will be able to [share it with users](/platform/manage/sharing) as is. However, you can still select `Run Validation` from the _Version Overview_ tab in the Platform UI or run the `zapier validate` command [in the Platform CLI](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/cli.md#validate) to be notified of any issues and recommendations to better the user experience.

To help better address a check in communication, each check is given a unique ID, consisting of a capital letter and three digits, such as `D001`.

You don’t need to know the implication of the initial capitial letter. But if you’re curious, they are:

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **C**ompatibility | Only apply when your integration is public, these checks verify how the new version is backward compatible with the currently public version. They ask questions like “would this change break existing Zaps, Zap Templates, or connected accounts?” |
| **D**efinition | Definition of the integration, including auth and trigger/search/action configurations. Some of these checks could block you from saving/pushing if the violation results in a broken trigger/search/action. |
| **M**arketing | Public-facing information, such as the app title, description, and logo. The intent of these rules is to give Zapier users a consistent style among texts and images across all public integrations. They’re more likely to block you from going public. |
| Connected **A**ccounts | Connected accounts that are linked to your integration. We verify these to ensure the authentication is working. |
| **S**tats | Usage stats, such as the number of users your integration has. These are more likely to block you from going public. |
| **T** - Zap History | Data from runs in your Zap History, produced by live (enabled) Zaps. These are more likely to block you from going public. The “T” checks are named as such for historical reasons. Zapier now shows tasks in the Zap History. |
| **U**ser | Things in the developer’s (your) account, such as Terms of Service acceptance. |
| **L**ifecycle | The lifecyle state of your integration or its versions, such as the visibility (private, pending, or public) and the version state (deprecated, non-production, or production). |
| **Z**ap | Things related to Zaps, such as the trigger samples you pulled into the Zap editor. |

When the checks are run, we’ll give a brief blurb summarizing the violation (with a check ID) along with a link to this page. This will act as a full reference explaining each error and giving examples for each.

- - -

## A001 - A Connected Account Exists

To ensure you’ve tested auth, we require you to set up at least one connected account.

- - -

## C001 - Try To Avoid Hiding/Removing Public Triggers/Searches/Creates

During promotion, we compare features of your currently public version with your soon-to-be-public version.

When you hide/remove a trigger in a new version, Zap Templates that use that trigger become invalid. Try to avoid this when you can. The same applies for searches and creates.

- - -

## C002 - Try To Avoid Removing Input Fields

During promotion, we compare features of your currently public version with your soon-to-be-public version.

When you change/remove the `key` property of an `input_field`, Zap Templates that use that field become invalid. Try to avoid this when you can.

- - -

## C003 - Try To Avoid Removing Sample Data

During promotion, we compare features of your currently public version with your soon-to-be-public version.

When you change/remove the `key` property of an item in your `sample`, Zap Templates that use that field become invalid. Try to avoid this when you can.

- - -

## D001 - Asks for API Key in Action Instead of in Auth

Some integrations incorrectly have `api_key` or similar as an an action field in an action instead of centrally used in auth. This is worse because action fields typically aren’t treated with the same level of security as auth fields are (e.g. scrubbed from logs) and aren’t action specific. Additionally, the ability to test the validity of auth doesn’t exist for action fields, so anything auth related should be put into an auth field instead.

- - -

## D002 - Provide Link in Help Text for Auth Fields

It’s often not obvious where a user can find their API credentials for a service. If you use a pasted API key as an authentication method, it’s strongly encouraged that you link the user to the page (or relevant help doc) that has their key.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```bash
API key is found on the "API Details" page in settings
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
Go to the [API Details](https://my.site.com/manage/api-details) screen from your
Website Dashboard to find your API Key.
```

- - -

## D003 - Connection Label Should Be Set

A Connection Label helps a customer remember which account they connected. It should be short and easily identifiable.

For both [Platform UI](/platform/build/connection-label) and [CLI](/platform/reference/cli-docs#connection-label), the connection label is a string. You can use any data returned by your test function.

For instance, if a successful run of the auth test returns the following data:

```bash
{
  "name": "Malcom Reynolds",
  "email": "youcanttaketheskyfromme@serenity.com",
  "job": "Captain"
}
```

Your connection label could be the following:

```bash
{{name}} - {{email}}
```

The most important role of the label is to uniquely identify the connection.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** connection label:

```bash
"Slack"
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** connection label:

```bash
{{user}} @ {{team}}
```

## D004 - ID Fields Should Have Dynamic Dropdowns

We’ve found that instead of instructing users to paste an item `id` into Zapier, providing them with a [dynamic dropdown](/platform/reference/cli-docs#dynamic-dropdowns) greatly increases the likelihood of the user setting up Zaps correctly. Users will still be able to map custom fields, but this gets them started on the right foot.

Read more about implementing dynamic dropdowns below:

*   [Platform UI](/platform/build/add-fields#dynamic-dropdown)
*   [Platform CLI](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md#dynamic-dropdowns)

- - -

## D005 - Dynamic Dropdown Connects to a Non-Existing Trigger

[Dynamic dropdowns](/platform/reference/cli-docs#dynamic-dropdowns) allow you to connect an input field to an existing trigger. The dropdown won’t work if the trigger key you specify doesn’t exist.

- - -

## D006 - REST Hook Trigger Needs a Polling URL

When users are setting up a hook-based (aka instant) Trigger, it’s important to have a polling fallback. For example, imagine a Zap that triggers on a new Slack message. If testing relies on the sending of a webhook, the test won’t complete without the user sending an actual message in a Slack channel, which is disruptive.

Instead, during testing, the Perform List (`performList`) operation fetches a (real) recent message using the provided URL for polling and uses it as the test result. The polling URL in a REST Hook trigger is only used for testing during a Zap setup.

It’s very important that the structure of an object from a webhook and from a poll are identical. Typically, this means modifying a poll result so that it looks like a hook. If a poll has fields that a hook doesn’t, the user may map them to a later step, and when the Zap runs live, the value will be blank. This can cause errors or unexpected results for users.

Let’s walk through an example. Say we have a `New Contact` REST Hook trigger. When a new contact is created, Zapier gets a webhook that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Bruce",
  "lastName": "Wayne",
  "job": "Batman"
}
```

The accompanying polling URL would look something like `https://site.com/contacts/list` and return:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "firstName": "Bruce",
      "lastName": "Wayne",
      "job": "Batman",
      "friends": [2, 3, 4]
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "firstName": "Alfred",
      "lastName": "Pennyworth",
      "job": "Butler",
      "friends": [1, 3]
    }
  ]
}
```

To match the polling result to the hook result, you would modify this response to remove the `friends` information, and return only the array of contacts, not the enclosing object.

The polling result is not used when a user skips testing the Zap step. In that case, Zapier uses the sample data.

See [Sample Data](/platform/build/sample-data) for more details on this.

- - -

## D007 - All URLs Should Be HTTPS

When handling customer data (which all Zapier functions do), it’s strongly encouraged that all communication take place securely. Using SSL is a big part of that, so ensure your URLs have HTTPS as their protocol.

If you need help setting up an SSL certificate for your API, we suggest [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** setup:

```bash
http://example.com/messages/subscribe
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
https://example.com/messages/subscribe
```

- - -

## D008 - Invalid Markdown Link

A valid markdown link consists of a pair of square brackets with the link text paired with a pair of parentheses that have the link itself. See the [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) for more info.

If you want to show a full link without actually linking to it, use backticks. This makes it clear to the user that they don’t need to click the link, it’s just used as an example. Any link used in plain text needs to either be a proper link or in backticks.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> examples of an **incorrect** implementation:

```bash
See [Google(https://google.com)
```

```bash
See https://google.com
```

<Icon icon="check"/> examples of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
See [Google](https://google.com)
```

```bash
See `https://google.com`
```

If you see this error, you should look through both the description for the trigger/action/search and the help text for any fields that might have bad links.

- - -

## D009 - Requires at Least One Search Field

When making a search step, it’s important to have a field to search by. Common examples for searching for a user are by name, email, and username.

- - -

## D010 - Missing Primary Key Fields in Static Sample Data

For polling triggers, the deduper uses the primary key field(s) to decide if it’s seen an object before. You can define one or more output fields as the primary key. Each field can be a string or a number. But it’s important that the primary key is unique. If no fields are set as `primary`, the deduper will by default use the `id` field as the primary key.

Hooks are not deduped, so they’re not required to have a primary key.

This check ensures the static samples in your integration definition contain the primary key fields. It’s similar to `T002`. The difference is that `T002` validates the live polling results in the Zap History.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```js
{
  // The deduper uses `id` field by default if no output fields are `primary`.
  // So this sample should have an `id` field for it to pass.
  "sample": {
    "contact_id": 4,
    "contact_name": "David"
  }
}
```

```js
{
  // `contact_id` is set as `primary`, but it's missing in the sample
  "sample": {
    "id": 4,
    "contact_name": "David"
  },
  "outputFields": [
    { "key": "contact_id", "primary": true },
    { "key": "contact_name" }
  ]
}
```

<Icon icon="check"/> examples of a **correct** implementation:

```js
{
  "sample": {
    "id": 4,
    "contact_name": "David"
  }
}
```

```js
{
  // This example defines `contact_id` as the unique primary key.
  "sample": {
    "contact_id": 4,
    "contact_name": "David"
  },
  "outputFields": [
    { "key": "contact_id", "primary": true },
    { "key": "contact_name" }
  ]
}
```

```js
{
  // If multiple fields are unique together, you can set them as `primary`.
  "sample": {
    "repo": "zapier/zapier-platform",
    "number": 1234,
    "title": "Add this feature please"
  },
  "outputFields": [
    { "key": "repo", "primary": true },
    { "key": "number", "primary": true },
    { "key": "title" }
  ]
}
```

- - -

## D011 - Redundant Help Text

Help text is optional and meant to provide non-obvious information or links for the user. If the label and help text are the same, they are considered redundant.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```bash
{
  "label": "Subdomain",
  "help_text": "subdomain"
}
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
{
  "label": "Subdomain",
  "help_text": "Where you (and your users) can access your forms, e.g., https://<SUBDOMAIN>.typeform.com"
}
```

- - -

## D012 - Static Sample Is Required

When a user sets up a trigger or action (create or search), they need sample data to be returned in order to have fields available to map in the subsequent steps. If testing the trigger returns no live results, we use static sample data as a fallback.

It’s very important that the data structure of the response from the actual trigger/action request and in the sample data are identical. Otherwise, users could map fields that don’t exist in the live results, which results in a broken Zap.

See [Sample Data](/platform/build/sample-data) for more details on this.

- - -

## D013 - Connects to a Non-Existing Search

[Search-Powered Fields](/platform/reference/cli-docs#search-powered-fields) prompt users to set up a search step to populate the value of the field. It won’t work if the search key you specify doesn’t exist.

- - -

## D014 - Has a Search Connector, but No Dynamic Dropdown

By design, to get the “Add a Search Step” button to appear for users in the Zap editor, an action needs both a search connector and a (valid) dynamic dropdown. If you can’t provide a valid dropdown, you can instead point to a dummy trigger that always returns an empty array.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** setup:

```json
{
  "key": "update_thing",
  "search": "thing.id"
}
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```json
{
  "key": "update_thing",
  "search": "thing.id",
  "dynamic": "things.id.name"
}
```

- - -

## D015 - Search-Or-Create Connects to a Non-Existing Action/Search

The search or create key you specify in `searchOrCreates` must reference to an existing search or action. Otherwise, it won’t work.

- - -

## D016 - Consists Only a Static Webhook

A REST Hook trigger missing a Subscribe or Unsubscribe endpoint, is presented to users as a [Static Webhook](https://cdn.zappy.app/3b35908a6a0c232087b5da807cf9d6fb.png). Static hooks are [not supported in public integrations](/platform/publish/integration-checks-reference#D017), but they could be used if the integration intends to remain private. However, Zapier doesn’t allow integrations that are a single static hook with the availability of [Webhooks by Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/webhook/integrations). To fix this, add more triggers/searches/actions.

- - -

## D017 - Static Hook Is Discouraged

When a REST Hook trigger is missing a Subscribe or Unsubscribe endpoint, it is presented to users as a [Static Webhook](https://cdn.zappy.app/3b35908a6a0c232087b5da807cf9d6fb.png). As static webhooks require manual intervention by the user to set up correctly, we no longer support adding new static webhook triggers to a public integration. Please set up Subscribe and Unsubscribe requests for this trigger, or use a Polling trigger type instead.

- - -

## D018 - Titlecased Label

In order to have a consistent style across trigger/action/search labels, they’re required to be presented in title case. If you fail this check, a passing version of your label will be shown.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```bash
new contact
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
New Contact
```

- - -

## D021 - Trigger Description Requirements

Trigger descriptions must start with `Triggers when` and end with a `.`.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> examples of an **incorrect** implementation:

```bash
Whenever there's a new contact, this goes?
```

```bash
Triggers whenever there's a new contact.
```

<Icon icon="check"/> examples of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
Triggers when there's a new contact.
```

- - -

## D022 - Creates Should Try to Have Static Input Fields

When making Zap Templates, it’s helpful to have input fields that are common for all users. Without any, it’s hard to create templates. If possible, add some static input fields that all users will be able to use.

- - -

## D023 - ISO-8601 Date/Time Format in Static Sample

To ensure Zapier can correctly parse dates and times, you should always use ISO-8601 format to represent dates or times. Timezone info should also be present if it contains time.

This check is similiar to `T003`. This check validates the static samples in your integration definition, while `T003` validates the live results in the Zap History.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> examples of an **incorrect** implementation:

```bash
01 Aug 2023
```

```bash
01 Aug 2023 06:50:30
```

```bash
2023-08-01T06:50:30
```

```
2023-08-01T06:50:30-0500
```

```
2023-09-15T09:59:59Z
```

- - -

## D024 - Static Sample Respects Output Field Definition

If you define output fields for a trigger/action/search, they should be consistent with the static sample data. The specific checks are:

*   “required” fields must be in the sample
*   field values in the sample match their field type

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```json
static sample: {"id": "1"}
output fields: [
    {"key":  "id", "type": "integer"},
    {"key": "email", "type": "string", "required": true}
]
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```json
static sample: {"id": 1, "email": "john@example.com"}
output fields: [
    {"key":  "id", "type": "integer"},
    {"key": "email", "type": "string", "required": true}
]
```

- - -

## D025 - URLs Should Not Be Dangerous URIs

In order to help prevent reflective cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks on Zapier customers, we require that URLs inside the app definition do not match potentially dangerous URI patterns which could be used to run malicious code.

Read more about XSS in the [OWASP Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** setup:

```bash
javascript:alert('XSS');//
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
https://example.com
```

- - -

## D026 - Manual domain validation recommended if using “inputFormat” or domain-related authentication fields

When utilizing authentication fields which allow a user to input their own domain or subdomain, we strongly recommend performing [manual validation](/platform/build/subdomain-validation) on the input data to ensure that it matches your expectations and filters out values which could be used to redirect users into unexpected domains.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```js
// No subdomain validation, trusting the user input
const response = await z.request({
  url: `https://${bundle.authData.yourSubdomainField}.mydomain.com/oauth/token`,
  // ...
});
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```js
// Manual validation step to ensure the subdomain matches your requirements
if (!/^[a-z0-9-]+$/.test(bundle.authData.yourSubdomainField)) {
  throw new Error(
    "Subdomain can only contain letters, numbers and dashes (-)."
  );
}

const response = await z.request({
  url: `https://${bundle.authData.yourSubdomainField}.mydomain.com/oauth/token`,
  // ...
});
```

- - -

## L001 - Version Is Deprecated

You can’t promote a deprecated version.

- - -

## L002 - Version Was Already Submitted

You can’t submit a version you’ve already submitted. If your integration was pushed back and you want to resubmit for another review, you should make changes on a **new** version and submit that.

- - -

## L003 - Version Is Already Production

This could happen if you’re attempting to promote a version that is already in production.

- - -

## L004 - Changes From Partners Are Blocked

This is necessary when Zapier team pushes changes to a partner-owned integration. Partners would have to coordinate with Zapier team via partners@zapier.com to lift the restriction for subsequent changes from them.

- - -

## M001 - App Category Is Required

To correctly categorize your integration on Zapier, please choose the category that fits best your app. You can specify a category for your integration in the Integration Settings page.

- - -

## M002 - Description Is Invalid

Your app’s description is a place to talk about your app, not ours! Even if we really like your app, you’re not allowed to say “Zapier” in your app’s description.

Additionally, it’s discouraged that you talk about how this integration will “sync” anything, as the space is supposed to be about your app itself instead of the Zapier integration in particular.

Lastly, this section should be short and sweet. A brief description (roughly tweet-sized) is best. Specifically, we’re looking for 1 - 3 sentences or at least 40 characters and a maximum of 140 characters.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** setup:

```bash
Google Translate enables Zapier users to translate text from one language into
another.
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```bash
Google Translate is a service that translates text from one language into another.
```

- - -

## M003 - Role Must Be Employee or Contractor

For your integration to go public, you must be employed or hired by the company who makes the app used in the integration. Go to the Integration Settings page to select your role.

- - -

## M004 - Invalid Logo

Your app’s logo will be used all over the site in square containers and in various sizes. To ensure it looks good at all sizes, the logo image must be:

*   a square PNG image
*   at least 256px by 256px in size
*   in RGBA mode so it can have a transparent background

To resize an image or convert an image to PNG, you can use this [tool](http://www.picresize.com/).

- - -

## M005 - Admin Team Member Email Domain Matches App Domain

To ensure that this integration is being submitted by the app owner we require that one of the Admin team members listed on the project have an email address with the same domain as your app’s homepage URL (which must also be present). You can add the homepage URL at `https://developer.zapier.com/app/APP_ID/version/APP_VERSION/settings`. Collaborator team members with the same domain as the homepage do not meet this requirement.

- - -

## M006 - Homepage URL Must Be Present

Each app must have a homepage URL. You can add the homepage URL at `https://developer.zapier.com/app/APP_ID/version/APP_VERSION/settings`.

- - -

## M007 - Public Integration Already Exists

We only allow one public integration in our app directory for a given app. If a public integration with the same title already exists, we won’t approve your submission to go public. If you’re the owner of the existing public integration, create an updated version with any edits and promote that instead of submitting a new integration.

- - -

## S001 - 3 Users with a live Zap

To verify user demand, there should be at least 3 users who have a live Zap using this integration. “Live” means the Zaps are switched on with at least one successful [Zap run in recent history](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496291148685).

You can [invite others to test your integration](/platform/manage/sharing) before publication.

- - -

## S002 - One Live Zap for Each Trigger/Search/Action

To ensure any show-stopping bugs are worked out, every visible trigger/search/action of your integration should have a live Zap that demonstrates it works. “Live” means the Zaps are switched on with at least one successful [Zap run in recent history](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496291148685).

You can create a [new Zapier account](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496197192461) and [invite it to your integration](/platform/manage/sharing) if you need extra Zaps.

You can also [contact us](https://developer.zapier.com/contact) if you need a trial extension.

- - -

## S003 - Live Version Count Limit

You can’t have more than 5 previous or current production versions with live Zaps. To continue, migrate users on older versions to a newer version.

- - -

## T001 - One Successful Zap Run for Each Trigger/Search/Action

There must be at least one successful Zap run for each visible trigger/action/search in your app.

To ensure you have run a live test of every visible trigger/action/search, create a Zap for each one, turn it on, and trigger a Zap run while it’s on.

This check is performed using the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) for accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

Learn more about the Zap History [here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496291148685).

## T002 - Missing Primary Key Fields in Live Polling Results

For polling triggers, the deduper uses the primary key field(s) to decide if it’s seen an object before. You can define one or more output fields as the primary key. Each field can be a string or a number. But it’s important that the primary key is unique. If no fields are set as `primary`, the deduper will by default use the `id` field as the primary key.

Hooks are not deduped, so they’re not required to have a primary key.

This check ensures the live polling results in the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) contain the primary key fields. It’s similar to `D010`. The difference is that `D010` validates the static samples in your integration definition.

This check is performed using the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) for accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> examples of an **incorrect** implementation:

## T003 - ISO-8601 Date/Time Format in Zap History

To ensure Zapier can correctly parse dates and times, you should always use ISO-8601 format to represent dates or times. Timezone info should also be present if it contains time.

This check is similiar to `D023`. This check validates the data in the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history), while `D023` validates the static samples in your integration definition.

This check is performed using the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) for accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

## T004 - Static Sample Contains a Subset of Keys from Live Result

Static samples provide Zapier users and partners a way to preview and map fields for a trigger or action without actually making a request to your API. It’s important that static samples reflect the real results from these calls as seen in the Zap History. Errors occur when a Zap uses a field from static sample that is not provided once the Zap is running.

This check requires the static sample you define for each trigger/action/search to contain a subset of the keys in the latest run in the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history).

This check is performed using the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) for accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```json
static: {"id": 1, "email": "john@example.com"}
live: {"id": 2, "name": "Alice"}
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```json
static: {"id": 1, "name": "John"}
live: {"id": 2, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}
```

## T005 - Live Trigger Result Respects Output Field Definition

This check takes the latest run from the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) and verifies whether the trigger result conforms to the output fields for the trigger in your integration (if defined). The specific checks are:

*   “required” fields must be in the trigger result
*   field values in the trigger result match their field type

This check is performed using the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) for accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```json
live result: {"id": "1"}
output fields: [
    {"key":  "id", "type": "integer"},
    {"key": "email", "type": "string", "required": true}
]
```

<Icon icon="check"/> an example of a **correct** implementation:

```json
live result: {"id": 1, "email": "john@example.com"}
output fields: [
    {"key":  "id", "type": "integer"},
    {"key": "email", "type": "string", "required": true}
]
```

## T006 - Polling Sample Contains a Subset of Keys from Live Result

For REST Hook triggers, we require you to provide a `Perform List` URL (check `D006`) so that users can retrieve a real data sample in the Zap editor. This is called a polling sample, and is created when you test the trigger in the Zap editor before turning it on.

Errors occur when a Zap uses a field from the polling sample that is not provided by the hook payload sent once the Zap is running.

To ensure this doesn’t happen, this check compares the latest item in the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) with the selected polling sample in the corresponding Zap. For it to pass:

*   There must be a Zap that is using the trigger.
*   The Zap must have at least one Zap run (the most recent run will be used).
*   The trigger must have been tested in the Zap editor via the Perform List method to retrieve a polling sample.
*   The polling sample should have the same data keys, or a subset of keys, compared to those available in the Zap run data.

This check is performed using the [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history) for accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```json
polling sample: {"id": 1, "email": "john@example.com"}
live: {"id": 2, "name": "Alice"}

```json
polling sample: {"id": 1, "name": "John"}
live: {"id": 2, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}

## Z001 - Polling Sample Respects Output Field Definition

For REST Hook triggers, we require you to provide a `Perform List` URL (check `D006`) so that users can pull a live sample in the Zap editor. This is called a polling sample.

This check takes the latest polling sample from a Zap with this trigger and verifies that the sample conforms to the output fields for the trigger in your integration (if defined). The specific checks are:

*   “required” fields must be in the polling sample
*   field values in the trigger result must match their field type

This check is performed using the Zaps in accounts belonging to the integration admins, so build your test Zaps in these accounts.

<Icon icon="xmark"/> an example of an **incorrect** implementation:

```json
polling sample: {"id": "1"}
output fields: [
    {"key":  "id", "type": "integer"},
    {"key": "email", "type": "string", "required": true}
]
```
