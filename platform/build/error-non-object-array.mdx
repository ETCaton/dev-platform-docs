title: "Error: Got a non-object result in the array, expected only objects"
description: "When using a REST Hook trigger, the data returned by the perform must be an array."
---
## Error shown

If an API returns a non-object result within the array, or an array of arrays, the following error will show.

`Got a non-object result in the array, expected only objects ( )`

The non-object result will be wrapped in the parentheses for the error message.

## Solution

If the data included in the webhook needs to be transformed, or includes multiple objects, you can add custom code to parse the response data in `bundle.cleanedRequest` within the Perform into an array of objects.

If your webhook already provides an array, remove the wrapping array that Zapier includes by default and simply return `bundle.cleanedRequest`.
